It's a blend of hardcore, punk, hip-hop, and noise which is at times really engaging and groovy, and at other times kind of off-putting. It's a fun ride, but not one for everyone.",

    review: "Featuring Travis Tabron, the original vocalist for <a href=\"#varials\">Varials</a>, Erase Them is essentially Varials if they had stuck to their older sound. That means it's unapologetically heavy, has sick grooves, plenty of breakdowns, and production that doesn't feel overly polished.",

    review: "Terror has long been one of those bands that I enjoy live, but didn't listen to much. <em>Pain Into Power</em> changed that. Easily their most cohesive and consistent album to date, it has some straight up bangers and the main riff on \"One Thousand Lies\" just gets me.",
