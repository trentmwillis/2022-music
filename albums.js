    review: "When I lived in Tokyo for part of a summer, my train often passed Nakano and Kichijoji amongst other stops, so when my friend turned me on to this album I was already inclined to like it just based on the song names.<br><br>While not my favorite emo release of the year, <em>ANORAK!</em> has some memorable, mathy riffs and is a surprisingly solid and straightforward album for a band steeped in Tokyo culture.",

    review: "I am not a huge fan of Deftones-esque alt-metal, but every now and then I like a song or two in the genre. Freshwater's debut LP is probably the first full album that broke that trend. It has the perfect balance of dreamy atmosphere, punishing riffs, and aggression. Not necessarily a ground-breaking album, but one that I found myself listening to over and over again.",

    genre: ["j-rock"],
    review: "Typically, I dislike genres like “J-Rock” because it reveals little about the sound of the band other than the country of origin. In Rottengraffty's case, I feel it is appropriate. The rock and metal band has such a variety over the course of <em>Hello</em> that it is hard to pin down a specific sub-genre. “Goodbye to Romance” is one of their softer songs and it hits right in the feels.",

They’re one of those rare bands where you can tell they stay true to their values, in their lyrics, their music, and the community they’ve fostered. “We Came To Play” showcases all of that while delivering catchy riffs to boot.",

Leaning more into pop-vocal stylings and ambient soundscapes than most of their contemporaries, <em>Dark Sun</em> should be right up there with Bad Omens' <em><a href=\"#bad-omens\">TDOPOM</a></em> getting radio play and attention for the scene (at least in my humble opinion).",

And, it is all reasonable in my opinion.<br><br>Tim Henson and crew have breathed new life into the scene by pushing the boundaries of progressive metal and rock beyond shredding virtuosity and into musical realms shared with pop and hip-hop. Put less pretentiously, they make pop music metalheads seem to like.",

With this being their first album since the departure of their vocalist, I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised.<br><br>The new vocalist shares a similar vocal range and fits the band's sound in a way that sounds less like a band member change and more like an evolution. Anyway, this song in particular slaps.",

No longer sounding anything like pop punk but leaning into elements of darker pop and alt rock music. Not the type of stuff I normally listen to, but they do it well (and put on a great live show).",

Regardless, the band makes catchy choruses and evokes the same sense of fun that I get from my favorite pop punk groups.<br><br>(P.S., not off this album, but \"<a href=\"https://youtu.be/5DjFpPSuGR0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mukanjyo</a>\" is an absolute banger that you should check out.)",

It may sound a bit cheesy, but in a scene filled with tough-guy posturing, it was remarkably refreshing to me. Not to mention, Counterparts still bring lovely guitar riffs and heavy breakdowns.",

I'm not typically a deathcore fan, but their fusion of trap and deathcore appealed to me as someone that grew up in the age of nu metal. <em>Lotus</em> continues and, in some ways, improves on that previous effort.<br><br>Some would describe it as cheesy, and sometimes it is, but overall I find it to be a fun and creative twist in a genre I typically find lacking in sonic diversity.",

Regulate deserves such comparisons on their self-titled release, but they are also very different. \"In The Moment\" definitely has some of the catchy-chorus, power-chord-driven hardcore that Turnstile has refined, but they also leave their own unique mark.

They've evolved somewhat over the course of their career, but with every release that core, reggae punk sound driven by MAH's vocals is still present.<br><br>This year, they saw international attention from \"The Rumbling\" which was used as the opening song for the final season of Attack on Titan. <em>Beware</em> features that song along with 3 others and is a great representation of SiM's overall sound. I hope they continue to gain more international attention so I don't have to travel to Japan to see them again.",

They continue to push the boundaries of metalcore in a way that I feel is both artistic and accessible (though some of my friends disagree and feel they're too \"avant garde\"). I've appreciated seeing the band mature and evolve into a distinct sound with totally abandoning their roots as a metalcore band.<br><br>\"Salt\" in particular is probably the most radio-friendly they've ever sounded and yet it doesn't feel out of place even amongst their heavier songs.",

That said, this album and <em>Morbid Stuff</em> are fun listens all the way through; they take punk music but make it more accessible with a little emo lyricism and twinkly guitars. Oh, and they put on a hell of a good live show (even in the rain).",
